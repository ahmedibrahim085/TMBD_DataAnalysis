    "> **Tip**: Welcome to the Investigate a Dataset project! You will find tips in quoted sections like this to help organize your approach to your investigation. Before submitting your project, it will be a good idea to go back through your report and remove these sections to make the presentation of your work as tidy as possible. First things first, you might want to double-click this Markdown cell and change the title so that it reflects your dataset and investigation.\n",

    "> **Tip**: Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. **Compute statistics** and **create visualizations** with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. You should compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data. Note that at least two or more kinds of plots should be created as part of the exploration, and you must  compare and show trends in the varied visualizations. \n",

    "> **Tip**: - Investigate the stated question(s) from multiple angles. It is recommended that you be systematic with your approach. Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables. You should explore at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.\n"

If it worked correctly, you should get a return code of 0, and you should see the generated .html file in the workspace directory (click on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left).\n",
